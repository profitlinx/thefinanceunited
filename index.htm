                *** In this program, clients pay no fees whatsoever until a debt is negotiated. Clients will know when fees are charged because they will approve every deal. Once a settlement is reached with a creditor, FDR immediately contacts the client for authorization. After the client authorizes the settlement, the fee associated with the debt is processed. All fees associated with the program are included in the monthly savings quoted to you by a debt consultant. The fees usually range from 15% to 25%, but the rate may vary depending on your state of residency. The estimates are based on prior results, which will vary depending on your specific enrolled creditors and your individual program terms. However, negotiated settlements this program obtains on their clients’ behalf resolve the entire account, including all accrued fees and interest.</small>
